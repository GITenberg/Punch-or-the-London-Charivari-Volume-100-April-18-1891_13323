    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <h4>[CONTINUED.]</h4>

    <p><i>March 13</i>.&mdash;Left Billsbury this morning by nine
    o'clock train, and came back to London. Brought with me the
    <i>Billsbury Standard</i>, and the <i>Billsbury Meteor</i> (the
    Radical paper.) Both have accounts of last night's meeting.
    Rather different, though.</p>

                valign="top">The era of indecision is past. In
                another column we give a full account of the
                important meeting of the Council of the
                Conservative Association, which was held last night
                for the purpose of selecting a Conservative
                Candidate for Billsbury. The proceedings were
                enthusiastic and unanimous ... Mr. RICHARD B.
                PATTLE, the selected Conservative Candidate, is a
                young man of the highest promise. He had a
                distinguished career at Oxford, where he obtained
                honours in History, and represented his College in
                the Torpid races for eight-oared crews. Since then
                he has been called to the Bar, where he has already
                secured a lucrative practice.... His speech last
                night had the right ring about it. It was eloquent,
                practical, convincing, modest and decided,
                thoroughly in harmony with the best traditions of
                the Conservative party, and remarkable for the
                proof it afforded of the devotion of Conservatives
                at all times to the highest interests of the
                working classes. We have no hesitation in
                declaring, as Colonel CHORKLE did last night, that
                with such a Candidate to oppose him, the fate of
                Sir THOMAS CHUBSON may be considered as already
                decided. If only all Conservatives will put their
                shoulders to the wheel and work hard, the stigma
                under which Billsbury now labours will be swept
                away. A Mass Meeting of Conservative electors will
                be held on an early date to ratify the decision of
                the Council, and inaugurate the period of hard work
                throughout the constituency.</td>

            <td></td>

            <td align="left"
                valign="top">Last night the Conservatives gave
                their annual performance of the good old farce
                entitled, <i>Choosing a Candidate; or, Who's got
                the Money-bags?</i> We are glad to be able to
                congratulate this distinguished body of amateurs on
                the modest success which attended their efforts.
                Most of the performers are well-known to the
                Billsbury public. Alderman TOLLAND, as the heavy
                father, provoked screams of laughter by the studied
                pomposity of his manner. His unctuous rendering of
                the catch-phrase, "Constitutional Progress," has
                lost none of its old force. Mr. CHORKLE was,
                perhaps, not so successful as we have sometimes
                seen him in his representation of a real Colonel,
                but the scene in which he attacked and routed
                LINDLEY MURRAY, went extremely well. Mr. JERRAM as
                a singing journalist, was admirable. We cannot help
                wondering why so remarkable an actor should confine
                himself to the provincial stage. We had almost
                forgotten to mention that the part of <i>The
                Candidate</i> was, on this occasion, assigned to a
                Mr. RICHARD PATTLE, a complete novice, whose
                evident nervousness seriously imperilled the
                success of the piece. He had omitted to learn his
                part adequately, and the famous soliloquy, "The
                country has need of me," was painfully bungled. Mr.
                PATTLE has few qualifications for the ambitious
                <i>rôle</i> he essayed, and his friends would be
                doing an act of true kindness if they insisted on
                his withdrawal from a profession for which he is in
                no way fitted. The performance will be repeated as
                usual next year.</td>
        </tr>

    <p>I suppose the <i>Meteor</i> people think that witty. When I
    got home, an awful thing happened. Mother, of course, wanted to
    see the papers, so I gave her the <i>Standard</i>, with which
    she was much pleased. She said it was evident I had made a
    wonderful impression, and that the Billsbury Conservatives were
    particularly sensible people! But, by some mistake, I left the
    <i>Meteor</i> lying on the drawing-room table. It seems that,
    in the afternoon, that sharp-tongued old hag, Mrs. SPIGOT,
    called. She saw the <i>Meteor</i>, took it up, and said, "Dear
    me, is this something about your son?" Mother, thinking it was
    the <i>Standard</i>, said, "Oh yes&mdash;do read it, Mrs.
    SPIGOT; it's a wonderfully accurate account, RICHARD says;" and
    that old cat read it all through. She then smiled, and said,
    "Yes, very flattering indeed." After she had gone, mother took
    it up, and, to her horror, found what it was. She was furious.
    When I got home in the afternoon, I found her in a state of
    what Dr. BAKER calls "extreme nervous excitement," with the
    <i>Meteor</i> lying in little scraps all over the drawing-room,
    just as if a paper-chase had been through there. She said,
    "Don't let me ever see that infamous paper again, DICK. The man
    who wrote it owes you some grudge, of course. Such a scoundrel
    ought to be denounced." I said I quite agreed with her. Later
    on, met VULLIAMY at the Club. We spoke about Billsbury. He
    asked me, with a sort of chuckle, if I'd seen the <i>Star</i>,
    and advised me to have a look at it, as there was something
    about me in it. This is what I found in the column headed
    "Mainly About People":&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mr. RICHARD PATTLE, who is to be the Conservative Candidate
    for Billsbury at the next election, is a young man of
    twenty-six. At Oxford he was generally called 'PODGE PATTLE' by
    his friends He took a fourth class in History. His oratorical
    efforts at the Union were not very striking, but he rowed in
    his College Torpid, which was bumped four times.</p>

    <p>"Mr. PATTLE, as maybe inferred from his nickname, is neither
    tall nor thin. He is a member of the Middle Temple, but his
    eloquence has not yet astonished the Courts of Law. His father
    died five years ago, leaving him a considerable fortune, part
    of which he proposes to waste in the hopeless attempt to turn
    out Sir THOMAS CHUBSON."</p>

    <p>Confound the people, I wish they'd mind their own business
    and leave me alone!</p>

    <p><i>March</i> 17.&mdash;Haven't been down to Billsbury again
    yet, but go the day after to-morrow to speak at a Mass Meeting
    of Conservative electors. However, I've had shoals of letters
    from the place&mdash;nearly all of them asking for
    subscriptions. The Five Bars Cricket Club, the Lilies Cricket
    Club, the Buffaloes Cricket Club, and the Blue Horse Cricket
    Club have all elected me a vice-president, and solicit the
    honour of my support. The Billsbury Free Dispensary is much in
    want of funds, and the Secretary points out that Sir THOMAS
    CHUBSON has subscribed £5 regularly every year. The United
    Ironmongers' Friendly Society wishes me to be an Honorary
    Member. CHUBSON subscribes £2 2<i>s.</i> to them. The Billsbury
    Brass Band, and three Quoit Clubs (the game is much played
    there) have elected me a member. The Secretary of the former
    sent me a printed form, which I was to fill up, stating what
    instrument I meant to play, and binding myself to attend at
    least one Band practice every week. Three "cases of
    heartrending distress" have appealed to me, "knowing the
    goodness of my heart." I shall have to consult TOLLAND, or some
    one, about all this. I get the <i>Meteor</i> and the
    <i>Standard</i> every day. The former goes on chaffing. Don't
    think JERRAM, in the <i>Standard</i>, writes as smartly as the
    other chaps. Must try to get him stirred up a bit. Just
    received letter from TOLLAND, saying he wants to talk to me
    before meeting about "matters connected with the Registration."
    More money, I suppose. Romeike, and all kinds of Press-Cutting
    Associations, keep on sending me that extract from the
    <i>Star</i>, till I'm fairly sick of it. They all want me to
    subscribe for Press-Cuttings. See them blowed first.</p>

    <p><i>Judge</i>. This is most annoying! Owing to the refusal of
    the Jury to serve, the time of the Bar, the Bench, and, I may
    even add, the prisoner, is wasted! I really don't know what to
    do! Mr. TWENTYBOB, I think you appear for the accused?</p>

    <p><i>Counsel for the Defence</i>. Yes, my Lord.</p>

    <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>with some hesitation</i>). Well, I do not
    for a moment presume to dictate to you, but it certainly would
    get us out of a serious difficulty if your client pleaded
    guilty. I suppose you have carefully considered his case, and
    think it advisable that he should not withdraw his plea?</p>

    <p><i>Counsel for the Defence</i>. No, my Lord, I certainly
    cannot advise him to throw up his defence. It is a
    serious&mdash;a deeply serious&mdash;matter for him. I do not
    anticipate any difficulty in establishing his innocence before
    an intelligent jury.</p>

    <p><i>Judge</i>. But we can't get a jury&mdash;intelligent or
    otherwise.</p>

    <p><i>Counsel for the Defence</i>. If no evidence is offered,
    my client should be discharged.</p>

    <p><i>Counsel for the Prosecution</i>. I beg pardon, but I must
    set my friend right. Evidence <i>is</i> offered in support of
    the charge, my Lord.</p>

    <p><i>Judge</i>. Yes; but there is no properly constituted body
    to receive and decide upon its credibility. I am glad that the
    Grand Jury (to whom I had the privilege of addressing a few
    observations upon our unfortunate position) have ignored a
    larger number of bills than usual; still the present case is
    before the Court, and I must dispose of it. Can you assist us
    in any way, Mr. PERPLEBAGGE?</p>

    <p><i>Counsel for the Prosecution</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I am
    afraid not, my Lord.</p>

    <p><i>Judge</i>. Well, I suppose I have no alternative but to
    order the Prisoner to be taken back to&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Prisoner</i>. To the place I was in last night? No,
    thankee!&mdash;not me! Look here, gemmen all, we knows one
    another, don't we? Well, just to oblige you&mdash;as Darmoor
    ain't 'alf bad in the summer, and as in course I <i>did</i> do
    it&mdash;I plead guilty!</p>

    <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>with a sigh of relief</i>). Prisoner at the
    Bar, we are infinitely beholden to you! [<i>Passes regulation

    <h2>HEARTHILY WELCOME.</h2>

    <p>1900 (<i>Somewhere about</i>).&mdash;Introduction into
    London of new Patent Smokeless Fuel, as experimentally
    exhibited in 1891 before the Prince of WALES and Empress
    FREDERICK in York Road, King's Cross. A few public-spirited
    householders insist on their cooks using it in the kitchen.
    Cooks of public-spirited householders unanimously give warning.
    No quotation of Fuel Company's shares on Stock Exchange.</p>

    <p>1900 (<i>Later</i>).&mdash;Very reforming Parliament just
    returned. Use of new Fuel made compulsory. Fuel shares go up
    from a nominal 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a share to £437 6<i>s.</i>
    8<i>d.</i> at a bound.</p>

    <p>1901.&mdash;London already much cleaner. Only two fogs
    (white) in whole of last winter. Consequent intense surprise of
    old residents, cabmen, link-boys, porters, and pickpockets.</p>

    <p>1902.&mdash;Retirement of several individuals, who declare
    they "liked the good old London fogs," to Black Country. Statue
    in Parian marble of inventor of new Fuel blocks erected on
    Thames Embankment.</p>

    <p>1904.&mdash;Government buys up patent rights of Company, at
    ruinous sacrifice. A Minister of Chimneyculture appointed, with
    Cabinet rank. Blocks reduced in price, and sold at all Post
    Offices across the counter. Postal messengers, on receipt of
    telephonic orders, bring truckfuls to any address within ten
    minutes.</p>

    <p>1905.&mdash;Green veils come into general use this summer,
    to keep off glare from white stone houses and other buildings
    in West-End of London. Several cases of partial loss of sight
    from extreme whiteness of dome of St. Paul's. Dean ordered (by
    County Council) to have dome lamp-blacked. Dean declines. Vote
    of thanks to him from resident staff of Ophthalmic
    Hospital.</p>

    <p>1906.&mdash;Owing to surprising and overpowering health of
    inhabitants (caused by total absence of smoke and fogs), County
    Council establishes Gymnasia, Rowing Matches, and free public
    Pugilistic Contests, in order to work off surplus muscular
    energies of population.</p>

    <p>1907.&mdash;Emigration of 2000 Doctors (who have no work to
    do) to one of General BOOTH's Colonies at South Pole. Show (in
    Temple Gardens) of delicate ferns and roses grown in atmosphere
    of Strand.</p>

    <p>1908.&mdash;Strike of Whitewashers, Laundresses, and House
    Painters, against lack of employment. Go about singing, "Oh,
    call the Fog-Fiend back to us!" with refrain, "Oh, when the
    Fogs were here with us, Would we had used them more!"</p>

    <p>1909.&mdash;Last surviving Chimney-sweeper, provided with a
    well-ventilated chamber at Madame Tussaud's. Special charge of
    sixpence for adults, threepence for children, made for
    privilege of seeing him.</p>

    <p>1910.&mdash;Rest of inhabitants of England, as well as
    foreign invalids, flock to London because of noted purity and
    salubrity of its climate. Riviera deserted. London a little
    over-crowded, but very clean.</p>

    <h3>THREE ACRES AND AN EGG.</h3>

    <p>The following pleasing announcement appears in the
    advertisement columns of the <i>East of Fife
    Record</i>.&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><big><big>W</big></big>ANTED, COTTAGERS and others to
        HATCH EGGS. Liberal Terms. Apply, &amp;c.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We are glad to see the men of Fife thus taking the lead in
    creating new openings for the agricultural labourer. Of course
    the weather will have much influence upon the success of the
    new avocation. To sit out hatching eggs in one of such
    blizzards as we have had since Christmas would be exceedingly
    inconvenient, upon whatever "Liberal terms." But, given a fair
    summer day or a quiet autumn evening, there seems something
    quite idyllic in the picture of the agricultural labourer
    sitting out in his own Three Acres hatching
    eggs,&mdash;probably laid by the Cow.</p>

    I now want to use part of the same room for the manufacture of
    fireworks. The place I don't think is too dark, as I have it
    constantly lighted by naked gas-jets. Would there be any need

    <h2>MR. PUNCH'S POCKET IBSEN.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Condensed and Revised Version by Mr. P.'s Own Harmless
    Ibsenite.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. II.&mdash;NORA; OR, THE BIRD-CAGE (ET DIKKISVÖIT).</h3>

    <h4>ACT III.</h4>

    <p><i>The same Room&mdash;except that the sofa has been
    slightly moved, and one of the Japanese cotton-wool frogs has
    fallen into the fireplace.</i> Mrs. LINDEN <i>sits and reads a
    book&mdash;but without understanding a single line.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Linden</i> (<i>laying down book, as a light tread is
    heard outside</i>). Here he is at last! (KROGSTAD <i>comes in,
    and stands in the doorway.</i>) Mr. KROGSTAD, I have given you
    a secret <i>rendezvous</i> in this room, because it belongs to
    my employer, Mr. HELMER, who has lately discharged you. The
    etiquette of Norway permits these slight freedoms on the part
    of a female Cashier.</p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> It does. Are we alone? (NORA <i>is heard
    overhead dancing the Tarantella.</i>) Yes, I hear Mrs. HELMER's
    fairy footfall above. She dances the Tarantella
    now&mdash;by-and-by she will dance to another tune!
    (<i>Changing his tone.</i>) I don't exactly know why you should
    wish to have this interview&mdash;after jilting me as you did,
    long ago, though?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Don't you? <i>I</i> do. I am a widow&mdash;a
    Norwegian widow. And it has occurred to me that there may be a
    nobler side to your nature somewhere&mdash;though you have not
    precisely the best of reputations.</p>

             squillikins!"
    </div>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> Right. I am a forger, and a money-lender; I am
    on the staff of the Norwegian <i>Punch</i>&mdash;a most
    scurrilous paper. More, I have been blackmailing Mrs. HELMER by
    trading on her fears like a low cowardly cur. But, in spite of
    all that&mdash;(<i>clasping his hands</i>)&mdash;there are the
    makings of a fine man about me <i>yet</i>, CHRISTINA!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.</i> I believe you&mdash;at least, I'll chance it.
    I want some one to care for, and I'll marry you.</p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>). On condition, I
    suppose, that I suppress the letter denouncing Mrs. HELMER?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.</i> How can you think so? I am her dearest
    friend: but I can still see her faults, and it is my firm
    opinion that a sharp lesson will do her all the good in the
    world. She is <i>much</i> too comfortable. So leave the letter
    in the box, and come home with me.</p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> I am wildly happy! Engaged to the female
    Cashier of the Manager who has discharged me, our future is
    bright and secure!</p>

        furniture straight; presently a noise is heard outside,

        in fancy dress, and he in an open black domino.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. I shan't! It's too early to come away from such
    a nice party. I <i>won't</i> go to bed! [<i>She
    whimpers.</i></p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>tenderly</i>). There'sh a naughty lil'
    larkie for you, Mrs. LINEN! Poshtively had to drag her 'way!
    She'sh a capricious lil' girl&mdash;from Capri. 'Scuse
    me!&mdash;'fraid I've been and made a pun. Shan' 'cur again!
    Shplendid champagne the Consul gave us&mdash;'counts for it!
    (<i>Sits down, smiling.</i>) Do you <i>knit</i>, Mrs.
    COTTON?... You shouldn't. Never knit. 'Broider. (<i>Nodding to
    her, solemnly.</i>) 'Member that. Alwaysh <i>'broider</i>.
    More&mdash;(<i>hiccoughing</i>)&mdash;Oriental! Gobblesh
    you!&mdash;goo'ni!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Linden</i>. I only came in to&mdash;to see NORA's
    costume. Now I've seen it, I'll go. [<i>Goes out.</i></p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Awful bore that woman&mdash;hate boresh!
    (<i>Looks at</i> NORA, <i>then comes nearer.</i>) Oh, you
    prillil squillikins, I <i>do</i> love you so! Shomehow, I feel
    sho lively thishevenin'!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>goes to other side of table</i>). I won't
    <i>have</i> all that, TORVALD!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Why? ain't you my lil' lark&mdash;ain't thish
    our lil' cage? Ver-<i>well</i>, then. (<i>A ring.</i>) RANK!
    confound it all! (<i>Enter</i> Dr. RANK.) RANK, dear old boy,
    you've been (<i>hiccoughs</i>) going it upstairs. Cap'tal
    champagne, eh? <i>'Shamed</i> of you, RANK! [<i>He sits down on
    sofa, and closes his eyes gently.</i></p>

    <p><i>Rank</i>. Did you notice it? (<i>with pride</i>). It was
    almost incredible the amount I contrived to put away. But I
    shall suffer for it to-morrow (<i>gloomily</i>). Heredity
    again! I wish I was dead! I do.</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Don't apologise. TORVALD was just as bad; but
    he is always so good-tempered after champagne.</p>

    <p><i>Rank</i>. Ah, well, I just looked in to say that I
    haven't long to live. Don't weep for me, Mrs. HELMER, it's
    chronic&mdash;and hereditary too. Here are my P.P.C. cards. I'm
    a fading flower. Can you oblige me with a cigar?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>with a suppressed smile</i>). Certainly. Let
    me give you a light?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[RANK <i>lights his cigar, after several ineffectual
        attempts, and goes out.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>compassionately</i>). Poo' old
    RANK&mdash;he'sh very bad to-ni'! (<i>Pulls himself
    together.</i>) But I forgot&mdash;Bishness&mdash;I mean,
    bu-si-ness&mdash;mush be 'tended to. I'll go and see if there
    are any letters. (<i>Goes to box.</i>) Hallo! someone's been at
    the lock with a hairpin&mdash;it's one of <i>your</i> hairpins!
    [<i>Holding it out to her.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>quickly</i>). Not mine&mdash;one of BOB's,
    or IVAR's&mdash;they both wear hairpins!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>turning over letters absently</i>). You
    must break them of it&mdash;bad habit! What a lot o' lettersh!
    <i>double</i> usual quantity. (<i>Opens</i> KROGSTAD's.) By
    Jove! (<i>Reads it and falls back completely sobered.</i>) What
    have you got to say to <i>this</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>crying aloud.</i>) You shan't save
    me&mdash;let me go! I <i>won't</i> be saved!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Save <i>you</i>, indeed! Who's going to save
    <i>Me</i>? You miserable little criminal. (<i>Annoyed.</i>)
    Ugh&mdash;ugh!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>with hardening expression</i>). Indeed,
    TORVALD, your singing-bird acted for the best!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Singing-bird! Your father was a
    rook&mdash;and you take <i>after</i> him. Heredity again! You
    have utterly destroyed my happiness. (<i>Walks round several
    times.</i>) Just as I was beginning to get on, too!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. I have&mdash;but I will go away and jump into
    the water.</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. What good will <i>that</i> do me? People will
    say <i>I</i> had a hand in this business (<i>bitterly</i>). If
    you <i>must</i> forge, you might at least put your dates in
    correctly! But you never <i>had</i> any principle! (<i>A
    ring.</i>) The front-door bell! (<i>A fat letter is seen to
    fall into the box</i>; HELMER <i>takes it, opens it, sees
    enclosure, and embraces</i> NORA.) KROGSTAD won't split. See,
    he returns the forged I.O.U.! Oh, my poor little lark,
    <i>what</i> you must have gone through! Come under my wing, my
    little scared song-bird.... Eh? you <i>won't!</i> Why, what's
    the matter <i>now</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>with cold calm</i>). I have wings of my own,
    thank you, TORVALD, and I mean to use them!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. What&mdash;leave your pretty cage, and
    (<i>pathetically</i>) the old cock bird, and the poor little
    innocent eggs!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Exactly. Sit down, and we will talk it over
    first. (<i>Slowly.</i>) Has it ever struck you that this is the
    first time you and I have ever talked seriously together about
    serious things?</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Come, I do like that! How on earth could we
    talk about serious things when your mouth was always full of
    macaroons?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>shakes her head</i>). Ah, TORVALD, the mouth
    of a mother of a family should have more solemn things in it
    than macaroons! I see that now, too late. No, you have wronged
    me. So did Papa. Both of you called me a doll, and a squirrel,
    and a lark! You might have made something of me&mdash;and
    instead of that, you went and made too much of me&mdash;oh, you
    <i>did</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Well, you didn't seem to object to it, and
    really I don't exactly see what it is you <i>do</i> want!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. No more do I&mdash;that is what I have got to
    find out. If I had been properly educated, I should have known
    better than to date poor Papa's signature three days after he
    died. Now I must educate <i>myself</i>. I have to gain
    experience, and get clear about religion, and law, and things,
    and whether Society is right or I am&mdash;and I must go away
    and never come back any more till I <i>am</i> educated!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Then you may be away some little time? And
    what's to become of me and the eggs meanwhile?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. That, TORVALD, is entirely your own affair. I
    have a higher duty than that towards you and the eggs.
    (<i>Looking solemnly upward.</i>) I mean my duty towards
    Myself!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. And all this because&mdash;in a momentary
    annoyance at finding myself in the power of a discharged
    Cashier who calls me "I say TORVALD," I expressed myself with
    ultra-Gilbertian frankness! You talk like a silly child!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Because my eyes are opened, and I see my
    position with the eyes of IBSEN. I must go away at once, and
    begin to educate
    myself.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"
       id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. May I ask how you are going to set about
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Certainly. I shall begin&mdash;yes, I shall
    <i>begin</i> with a course of the Norwegian theatres. If
    <i>that</i> doesn't take the frivolity out of me, I don't
    really know what <i>will</i>! [<i>She gets her bonnet and ties
    it tightly.</i></p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Then you are really going? And you'll never
    think about me and the eggs any more! Oh, NORA!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Indeed, I shall, occasionally&mdash;as
    strangers. (<i>She puts on a shawl sadly, and fetches her
    dressing-bag.</i>) If I ever do come back, the greatest miracle
    of all will have to happen. Good-bye! [<i>She goes out through
    the hall; the front-door is heard to bang loudly.</i></p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>sinking on a chair</i>). The room empty?
    Then she <i>must</i> be gone! Yes, my little lark has flown!
    (<i>The dull sound of an unskilled latchkey is heard trying the
    lock; presently the door opens, and Nora, with a somewhat
    foolish expression, reappears.</i>) What? back already! Then
    you <i>are</i> educated?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>puts down dressing-bag</i>). No, TORVALD,
    not yet. Only, you see, I found I had only threepence-halfpenny
    in my purse, and the Norwegian theatres are all closed at this
    hour&mdash;and so I thought I wouldn't leave the cage till
    to-morrow&mdash;after breakfast.</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>as if to himself</i>). The greatest
    miracle of all <i>has</i> happened. My little bird is not in
    the bush <i>just</i> yet!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[NORA <i>takes down a showily bound dictionary from the
        shelf and begins her education</i>; HELMER <i>fetches a bag
        of macaroons, sits near her, and tenders one humbly. A
        pause.</i> NORA <i>repulses it, proudly. He offers it
        again. She snatches at it suddenly, still without looking
        at him, and nibbles it thoughtfully as Curtain
        falls.</i></p>

    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. XXIV.&mdash;THE GIVER OF PARTIES.</h3>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/185.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>It may be that "Party," in the sense of a hospitable
    entertainment, is an obsolete word, and that those who speak of
    "giving a party" prove themselves, by the mere expression, to
    be fogeys whom the rushing stream of London amusements has long
    since thrown up on the sandy bank of middle age, there to grow
    dull and forget that their legs were ever apt for the waltz, or
    their digestions able to cope with lobster mayonnaise at 2 A.M.
    Yet, though he who thus speaks may not be as smart as a swell,
    or as much up to date as a church-parade-goer, the expression
    will serve, for it indicates comprehensively enough every
    variety of entertainment known to the London Season&mdash;the
    dance, the dinner, the reception, the music at home, the
    tea-party, and the theatre-party, for all these in her
    benevolence does the Giver of Parties offer to us, and all
    these does she find the world of London eager to accept. Now it
    would seem, one would imagine, to be the easiest thing in the
    world, if only the money be not wanting, to give a party. A
    hostess, so someone may say, has but to invite her friends, to
    light her rooms, to spread her tables, to set the champagne
    flowing, to order an awning, and to hire music and a linkman,
    and the thing is done. The result of all this will no doubt be
    a party&mdash;of a sort, but of a sort far different, however
    gorgeous it may be, from the splendid and widely-advertised
    gatherings which the genuine Giver of Parties organises. For in
    the one variety it is just possible that enjoyment may be one
    of the main objects sought and attained; in the latter it is
    certain that enjoyment, though it is not always absent, must
    yield the precedence to social success and promotion in the
    scale of Society. These are the objects that the Giver of
    Parties, as it is proposed to describe her, has at heart, and
    to their attainment she devotes herself with a persistent and
    all-embracing energy which no disappointment is capable of
    daunting. The envy of her friends, the smiles and the presence
    of Royalty, may be hers, but there is always some loftier
    height to which she must climb before she can say to herself,
    "<i>J'y suis, j'y reste</i>," and be thankful.</p>

    <p>Her life has known many changes. Her parents were county
    people of good descent and position, but of a reduced income,
    for which they apparently sought compensation in an increasing
    family, mostly daughters. It was necessary that she should
    marry young, and she submitted to necessity by accepting the
    proposal of a man some ten years her senior, who had already
    come to be favourably spoken off for the success of his
    commercial ventures. It is needless to add that all her
    relations took good care to impress upon her mind the fact that
    the alliance was an honour to her husband, whose wealth, even
    though it might in time rival that of the ROTHSCHILDS, could
    never make him fit to be mentioned in the same breath with one
    who numbered among her remoter ancestors a Baron, who had
    fought and bled on many fields for King CHARLES THE FIRST.
    However, the marriage took place in spite of the inequality of
    rank, and the much-honoured husband bore his wife with him to
    London, where for a time the modest comfort of a house in
    distant Bayswater satisfied them. Business prospered, and money
    came pouring in. The wife, who, it must be said, had undeniable
    beauty, excellent manners, and the trick of intuitively
    adapting herself to any society, was taken up by a great lady
    who happened to see her holding a stall at a large bazaar in
    which the fashionable world took some interest. Acting upon the
    great lady's suggestion, she was photographed in the becoming
    Tyrolese peasant's costume which she wore as a stall-holder,
    and the photograph was in some mysterious way engraved in all
    the illustrated papers of the following week. Her name was
    enshrined in paragraphs, she was observed in the Royal
    Enclosure at Ascot, she was introduced to a Royal personage who
    was pleased to confer upon her the distinction of his smiles,
    and to mention her to the select circle of his intimates as "a
    very pretty, pleasant little woman." And thus she was started
    upon the thorny path of ambitious pleasure.</p>

    <p>It is well known that the sacred fire of fashion
    burns&mdash;or is supposed to burn&mdash;in Belgravia alone.
    Its warmth drew her irresistibly. Bayswater became too cold to
    hold her, and early in the following year it was announced that
    a large house in the purlieus of Grosvenor Square had been
    purchased by her husband. However, she was content to climb by
    degrees, and, in her first season of social brilliancy, she
    restricted herself to a small and early dance, and a musical
    evening. At the dance, universal admiration was excited by the
    lavish profusion of the flowers with which her staircase was
    adorned, by the excellent quality of the champagne, and the
    inexhaustible supply of oysters. At the musical evening the
    music was as admirably rendered as it was completely neglected.
    And at both parties only those people were present as to whose
    social status and absolute "rightness" there could be no
    question. Indeed the dancer, whose foot had been trodden upon
    at the former, might console herself with the thought that none
    but a noble boot had caused her pain; while at the latter the
    sounds of heavy breathing, which mingled inharmoniously with
    Mlle. FALSETTI's <i>bravura</i>, were forgiven, in
    consideration of the exalted rank of their producer. Her
    success seemed now to be assured, and even the muttered
    discontent of a neglected husband, who was foolish enough to
    prefer comfort to smartness, began to subside. In the following
    year her entertainments became even more splendid, and less
    comfortable. She took a house at Ascot, and, triumph of
    triumphs! a scion of Royalty deigned to accept her
    hospitality.</p>

    <p>After this, one would have supposed that she might have
    reposed for a space. But the penalty of social life is its
    never-ending necessity for movement. Jealous rivals abound to
    dispute a hardly-won supremacy, and the least sign of faltering
    may involve extinction. Yet it must be said that she is kind to
    her own, even when she is most brilliant. She brings out a
    daughter to be the delight of young Guardsmen, and marries her
    to a widowed Peer; she furbishes up forgotten relations, and
    allows them to shine in the rays of her glory; she is
    charitable after the manner of fancy fairs, and the hospitality
    of her house becomes proverbial. But, in the midst of all the
    bustle, the confusion, and the rattling turmoil of her career,
    she sometimes sighs for the undistinguished ease of her life in
    the pre-Royal days, sighs, and returns with fresh vigour to the
    struggle.</p>

    <p>And so the pleasureless days of the pleasure-seeker follow
    one another, each with its particular legacy of little
    strivings, until, at the last, consolation may come from the
    thought that there is at least one place where there are many
    mansions, but no social ambitions.</p>

    <p>NEW PRAYER-BOOK REVISION.&mdash;Several alterations will now
    have to be made in the marriage service. If it be permissible
    for the bride to omit her promise "to obey," as is reported to
    have been the case at a wedding last week, why should any
    undertaking "to love," "to honour," "to cherish," and so forth
    remain in the text? With all this left out, a marriage, which,
    of course, will no longer be an ecclesiastical rite, will
    hardly be a very civil ceremony. In course of time all the
    promises will be made either explicitly or implicitly
    conditional, the only question being what is the least possible
    obligation that can be incurred by both contracting parties at
    the smallest possible expense.</p>

    <h4>(<i>A Page from a Vade Mecum for Political
    Economists.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Question</i>. Can you tell me how long an Author has a
    right to the profits arising out of his literary labours?</p>

    <p><i>Answer</i>. Forty-two years, or the term of his natural
    life plus seven years further, whichever may be the longer.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And should Lord MONKSWELL's Copyright Bill, which
    has been read a First Time in the House of Peers, become law,
    will not this right be extended to thirty years after the death
    of the Author?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> It will, to his great advantage. The same measure
    contains other valuable provisions to secure to the Author the
    just profit of his brain-work.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> But will not these advantages be purchased at the
    price of a loss to the general good?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Very likely&mdash;the community will suffer for
    the benefit of the individual.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> In like manner a Patentee, who invents a most
    useful article, enjoys (for a consideration) a monopoly of its
    sale, does he not?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> For fourteen years. This enables him to recoup
    himself for the thought and labour he has employed in the most
    useful article's construction.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> If Author and Inventor were allowed an absolute
    monopoly of the profits arising out of their brain-work, it
    would be immoral?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> No doubt, as the individuals would benefit at the
    cost of the community.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Why should a butterman, then, have an absolute
    right in the sale of his butter?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Because butter is butter, and brains are merely
    brains.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And would it not be for the benefit of the
    community if the landowner of a freehold were deprived of his
    rights after a term of years, and his holding be given to the
    public?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Oh dear, no! Land, as RUDYARD KIPLING would say,
    "is quite another story!"</p>

    <p>The first night of the Mixed Italian Opera Season, 1891. We
    open with GLÜCK's <i>Orféo</i>, and, in a strong opera-glass,
    we drink to DRURIOLANUS OPERATICUS, and say, "Here's G-luck
    t'you!" Nothing can begin the season better than the appearance
    of GIULIA and SOFIA RAVOGLI&mdash;specially
    GIULIA&mdash;"There's something 'bout GIULIA So werry
    peculia'"&mdash;(<i>Old Song</i>)&mdash;in this short Opera,
    that is to say, an Opera which should be short were it not for
    the "waits" between the Scenes and Acts, which, as it is in the
    nature of weights to do, must always make even the lightest
    Opera seem heavy. Mlle. GIULIA sang and acted perfectly. Her
    rendering of the last song was most pathetic. This delicious
    melody the audience would have had over and over again, not in
    merry mood, for we are never merry in the hearing of such sweet
    music, but in appreciative sympathy with the woes of
    <i>Orpheus</i> so sweetly expressed. The lines in
    <i>Bombastes</i> rise in my memory:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"So ORPHEUS sang of old, or poets lie,</p>

    </div>

    <p>On consideration, however, I will <i>not</i> quote the
    remainder, but will say simply that we were all charmed.
    Welcome, at the commencement of another season, to Mlle.
    BAUERMEISTER, appearing as <i>Cupid</i>. To-morrow she will be
    <i>Dame Marta</i>! Wonderful! "Time cannot stale her infinite
    variety." How is it, O <i>première danseuse</i>, my pretty
    pretty Polly Hop-kino PALLADINO, Principal Shade among all
    these Happy but Shady characters, that thou didst not choose a
    classic dance in keeping with the character of the music and of
    the ideal&mdash;I distinctly emphasise
    "<i>ideal</i>"&mdash;surroundings? What oughtest thou to
    represent in the Elysian Fields? A Salvationised "Dancing
    Girl," without bonnet and tambourine? Nay, not so; but rather
    the very spirit of classic grace and elegance, moving
    rhythmically to melodious measure. In such a Scene as this
    ought to be, we want as much idealism as your graceful art can
    lend, otherwise we are only among our old friends, "the ladies
    and gentlemen of the Chorus"&mdash;bless em!&mdash;representing
    most substantially the "Shades of the Blessed," who appear to
    be Shades of every colour. GIULIA RAVOGLI, however, kept us
    entranced in the ancient classic land where once we used to
    wander. "<i>Vive Lemprière!</i>"</p>

    <p><i>Second Night</i>.&mdash;<i>Faust</i>, with a new
    <i>Marguerite</i>, Gay dog, <i>Faust</i>. How many
    <i>Marguerites</i> have there been even in my time! Same old
    story. <i>Faust</i> not a whit improved by
    experience&mdash;going on just the same as ever. His new
    <i>Marguerite</i> does credit to his choice, for Mlle.
    EAMES&mdash;(isn't she Miss EAMES, and neither Mademoiselle nor
    Signora? And doesn't she hail from Columbia?&mdash;but no
    matter)&mdash;is a sweet-looking <i>Marguerite</i>, with a
    voice as true as is her heart to <i>Faust</i>. A genuine
    <i>Gretchen</i>, simple not brilliant. Brilliancy she leaves to
    property diamonds, but awakes enthusiasm, by her judicious
    acting over the inert body of <i>Valentine</i>, when she
    attempts no sudden Colwell-Hatchney shriek, always so perilous.
    Signor PEROTTI looked as <i>Faust</i> might have done, had he
    been elected an Alderman of the City of London and acted up to
    the character. If DRURIOLANUS had lent him his Sheriff's chain
    to wear, Signor PEROTTI would have been perfect, that is from
    this point of view. M. MAUREL excellent as <i>Mephisto</i> in a
    new suit of clothes. He appears now as "The Gentleman in
    Grey"&mdash;rather suggestive of his having become a Volunteer,
    and a member, of course, of "the Devil's Own." Imagine
    <i>Mephistopheles</i> re-dressed at last! On both nights Signor
    MANCINELLI, the Conductor, seemed pleased, and that's
    something.</p>

    <p>Great feature in Covent Garden this year is the decoration
    of the Pit-tier Lobby. DRURIOLANUS, feeling happy at the Opera
    prospects, and rejoicing in a full subscription, said to the
    Committee, "Gentlemen, let's have 'glasses round'!" Some
    officious person, hearing this, mistook the meaning of the
    great Chief, and straightway ran off and ordered
    <i>looking-glasses all round for the Lobby!</i> Grand effect!
    brilliant! dazzling!&mdash;too much so, in fact; several
    glasses too much. So, after a couple of nights' reflection,
    when the <i>habitués</i> came on Thursday, behold, two or three
    of the aristocratic mirrors or Peer-glasses had disappeared,
    the hat-pegs of former times had been restored, the wounded
    susceptibilities of the Stall-keepers whose occupation was
    partly gone, were healed, and where gloom was spreading,
    wreathed smiles once more prevailed. Even now these
    Opera-glasses are rather too powerful. Still, "let us see
    ourselves as others see us," is a good practical motto for the
    loiterer in the lobby, as he catches sight of himself, <i>en
    passant</i>, and wonders who that chap is, whose face he has
    seen somewhere before, but whose name he can't for the life of
    him recollect.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;<i>Carmen</i>. Disappointed with
    JULIA RAVOGLI in this, though there are some fine bits of
    acting in it. Didn't care much about Sister SOFIA as <i>Mickie
    the Maiden</i>, M. LUBERT's <i>Don José</i> good but not great;
    and M. CELLI, who, in default of M. DEVOYOD's not being able to
    appear, took the part of <i>Escamillo</i>, was great, but not
    very good. He was, however, well supported by Signor RANDEGGER
    and the Orchestra, and considering the difficulties he had to
    struggle with, including an apology in the bills, he came out
    of it safely.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Re-appearance of the great DE RESZKE
    Brothers, JOHN and NED (what's JOHN without an 'ed?) in
    <i>Lohengrin</i>. Admirable. JULIA RAVOGLI excellent as
    <i>Ortruda</i>, and M. MAUREL equally so as <i>Freddy</i>. But
    why did he "feather his skull," like the Jolly Young Waterman,
    in so remarkable a style? However, his <i>Freddy</i> is a
    feather in his cap with which he ought to be satisfied. Miss
    EAMES as <i>Elsa</i> even better than as <i>Marguerite</i>.
    Crammed house. "Friends in front" more than satisfied. Good
    start.</p>

    <h2>SWORD VERSUS LANCET!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>An incident in the next War.</i>)</h4>

    <p>"Now," said the Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Commanding-in-Chief,
    as he stood before his men; "I have the greatest confidence in
    your skill. There is not one of you present who cannot perform
    an operation as successfully as myself;" here there was a
    murmur of polite denial in the ranks. "Nay, it is no
    flattery&mdash;I mean it. These are my last instructions. We
    are few, the enemy are many. We are not only soldiers but
    medical men. And as medical men it is our business to cure the
    wounds that we inflict in our more strictly military
    capacity."</p>

    <p>Again there was a murmur&mdash;this time of cordial
    approval.</p>

    <p>"Well, Gentlemen, as we have been taught in our drill, what
    the first rank breaks, the rear rank must bandage up. This
    would be all very well if our numbers were told by thousands,
    or even hundreds, instead of tens. But to-day we must use the
    bayonet rather than the lancet, the bullet in preference to the
    pill." Stealthy applause followed this observation. "But be
    careful. Common humanity calls upon us to do as little damage
    as possible. You know your anatomy sufficiently well to avoid
    inflicting a wound upon a vital part, and can so arrange that
    your blows shall incapacitate rather than functionally derange.
    And now, my friends, put your instrument-boxes and
    pharmacopoeias in your haversacks, and draw your swords. All
    ready? Yes! Then, 'Up, Guards, and at them!'"</p>

    <p>With a wild cheer the Royal Regiment of Physicians and
    Surgeons (which had recently been admitted into the Service on
    the footing of the Royal Engineers) rushed forward. It was a
    beautiful sight to see them performing the most delicate
    operations in the kindest manner imaginable. The enemy
    trembled, wavered, and fled. In a moment the Royal Regiment had
    put up their swords and taken out their medical appliances.
    Their military duties done, and they were doctors once again,
    ready to help those who demanded their semi-civilian services.
    They had scarcely been engaged in this manner ten minutes when
    the Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Commanding-in-Chief cantered up to
    them. "Men," he cried, "drop your surgical instruments, and
    draw your swords. The enemy are again upon us! We must take
    their fort!"</p>

    <p>In a moment the Royal Regiment was on the march. On their
    way, some of their comrades, wounded by the foe (in a bungling
    fashion), appealed to them for succour.</p>

    <p>"Very Sorry," replied the
    Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Commanding-in-Chief, in a tone of
    commiseration; "very sorry indeed, but we can't attend to you.
    At this moment we are acting in our strictly military
    capacity!" And the Royal Regiment of Physicians and Surgeons,
    full of enthusiasm (but in rather loose formation) continued
    their march to the fort.</p>

    <p><i>Tourmalin's Time Cheques</i>, drawn on the bank of
    eccentric imagination by ANSTEY-GUTHRIE, is well worthy of the
    author of <i>Vice Versâ</i>. The construction of the story is
    as artful as it is artistic, but the Baron cannot give his
    reason for this opinion without jeopardising the reader's
    pleasure. Still the Baron feels pretty certain that when the
    much-amused and greatly-chuckling but diligent and
    conscientious peruser of this light-hearted romance arrives at
    the last few pages, he will frown, rub his eyes, refer back to
    the very commencement of the story,&mdash;and then? Will he
    bless ANSTEY and blow GUTHRIE, or bless GUTHRIE and blow
    ANSTEY, or will he, being more tickled than ever, rush off to
    recommend it at once to his best friends, anticipating renewed
    delight from their pleasure and perplexity? The Baron wishes
    that ANSTEY and GUTHRIE had settled between them to call it
    <i>Tourmalin's Time Bargains</i>; but it is very likely that if
    ANSTEY suggested it, GUTHRIE rejected it, or, if the Baron may
    be permitted to say so without infringement of copyright,
    "<i>vice versâ</i>." It is a great satisfaction to know that
    unlike the ERCKMANN-CHATRIAN collaboration, the ANSTEY-GUTHRIE
    partnership cannot be dissolved. JEKYL-AND-HYDE can cease to
    be, and JEKYL may alone survive; but the Baron rejoices in the
    fact of the mysterious bond between ANSTEY and GUTHRIE being
    indissoluble. Read <i>Tourmalin's Time Cheques</i>, and
    remember the prognostications of THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 6.</i>&mdash;School
    reopened after Easter Holidays. OLD MORALITY duly in his place,
    but not many of the boys. Civil Service Estimates on; PLUNKET
    in charge on Ministerial side; SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE Leader
    of Opposition. Hammered away all night on old familiar lines.
    Ghosts of old acquaintances feebly crossed floor, disappearing
    behind SPEAKER's chair. Kensington Palace, with its cost;
    Bushey House; Cambridge Cottage; admission to Holyrood Palace;
    the deer in Home Park at Hampton Court; the pheasants in
    Richmond Park; the frescoes in House of Lords; the Grille of
    the Ladies' Gallery: the British Consular House at
    Cairo&mdash;each came up in turn; talked about; protested
    against; explained; divided upon, and voted. PLUNKET left to
    himself on Treasury Bench; bore up with unflagging energy and
    perennial patience; has heard same points raised every year
    since he was First Commissioner; has made same replies, and has
    seen Votes passed. Long before he was in office same thing used
    to go on with other First Commissioners. That was before the
    SAGE had taken to politics. Good old
    RYLANDS&mdash;"Preposterous PETER"&mdash;was then the Grand
    Inquisitor. But it was the same deer, the same gas-bills, the
    same question of free residence for "that eminent warrior," as
    the SAGE to-night called him, the Dook of CAMBRIDGE.</p>

    <p>Oddly enough, almost only flash of humour through long
    sitting came from GEORGE CAMPBELL. Gave graphic description of
    his hanging about Holyrood Palace hankering after admission.
    According to existing regulation, admission to be gained only
    after bang goes two saxpences. For sixteen years Sir GEORGE
    ever lured to vicinity; sometimes casually entered doorway,
    proposing to loiter past ticket-collector; stopped by demand of
    a shilling, had resisted temptation. That was sad, but what he
    felt most acutely was injury done to his nation. Americans
    visiting Edinburgh on their way to Paris went to Holyrood:
    charged a shilling. "Ha! ha!" they cried, "see these stingy
    Scotchmen. They charge a shilling before they throw open their
    one Palace door, whilst in England you may roam through the
    Palaces free of
    charge,"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"
       id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>

    <p>"Sir," cried Sir GEORGE, his voice under generous excitement
    of the moment taking on rasping tone, "the arrangement is
    prejudicial to the reputation of Scotchmen."</p>

    <p>"This," said the SAGE, "will, I think, be an opportunity of
    going out for another cigarette."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Handsful of Votes in Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;NAPOLEON B. BOLTON strolled down to
    House to-night, intending to hear what TOMLINSON had to say on
    Emigration arrangements. In family circle it has always been
    considered that, as far as personal resemblance to NAPOLEON
    BONAPARTE goes, the late Prince JEROME wasn't in it with the
    Member for St. Pancras. BOLTON blushingly pooh-poohs the fond
    little fancy; but he is of kindly disposition; not inclined to
    insist on his opinion in controversy to other people's. Indeed,
    has gone so far as to furnish himself with fancy dress,
    fashioned on the style of that worn by the great NAPOLEON on
    State occasions. To-night, been at a children's party, showing
    himself in his uniform. Am told that, when he folds his arms,
    throws back his head, and recites, "On Linden, when the sun was
    low," you would think the Great Emperor had come back from St.
    Helena.</p>

    <p>Intended to-night to create sensation in House. Doubted
    whether, as he was not about to move the Address, he would be
    permitted to enter with sword by his side. But he would be free
    of the smoke-room; might posture in the Lobby; might read an
    evening paper in the tea-room, whilst others enviously glanced
    at his epaulettes.</p>

    <p>Here he was at ten minutes past nine standing in his
    favourite attitude at the Bar, no one having challenged his
    entrance. Fact is, House was up; not Counted Out, but having
    duly gone through the Orders and passed the Second Reading of
    an important measure. Such a day the Government had had! At
    Morning Sitting had ramped through the Orders, advancing Bill
    after Bill through critical stages. House nearly empty;
    Opposition effaced; Irish Members all absent except Brer
    RABBIT, who wanders about looking for Brer FOX. The only note
    of discord sounded in voice of GEORGE CAMPBELL. Report of
    Supply reached at a quarter to seven. At ten minutes to seven,
    in accordance with Rule ordering Morning Sitting, Debate must
    stop. One or two questions asked; quickly answered by PLUNKET;
    Vote after Vote agreed to on report stage. Then CAMPBELL gets
    up and wants to know about lighting the National History Museum
    at night?</p>

    <p>Twelve minutes to seven.</p>

    <p>PLUNKET looks anxiously at clock. If CAMPBELL would put his
    question and sit down he might be answered, and report stage
    got through. But CAMPBELL goes on till hand of clock points to
    ten minutes to seven.</p>

    <p>"Order, order!" cries SPEAKER. Time limit reached; no more
    debate; CAMPBELL not finished yet; attempts to proceed; angry
    shouts of "Order! Order!" before which he subsides. Then,
    watching opportunity, suddenly bolts up again and wants to
    explain that he was not opposing the passage of report stage of
    Supply. "No, but you talked it out," said PLUNKET, with
    something less than his customary suavity.</p>

    </div>

    <p>This happened more than two hours ago. There has been the
    suspension of the Sitting, the resumption at nine o'clock, the
    Second Reading of the Rating of Machinery Bill; and now all is
    over, the guests are fled, the garlands dead, and all but
    NAPOLEON B. BOLTON departed. He, in fact, has only just
    arrived, and wishes he had not been in such a hurry to quit the
    circle where of late he was the object of awed admiration.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Trenormous!</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;House filled up to-night; flowing
    tide evidently with us, including Mr. G., back after his
    holidays. Also Prince ARTHUR; been in training for some weeks
    in anticipation of long spurt in Committee on Irish Land Bill.
    Irish Members also returned in considerable force. Expected to
    find TIM HEALY arrive in fragments; but he's all there, much as
    usual.</p>

    <p>"How's Brer FOX?" I asked him, wishing to hear latest news
    from Ireland.</p>

    <p>"Oh," said he, "PARNELL's looking up."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" I asked, astonished at this
    testimony.</p>

    <p>"I mean, he's on his back, and, being in that position, must
    of course be looking up, if he's looking anywhere at all."</p>

    <p>Light-hearted TIM! Time does not wither, or DALTON O'BRIEN
    stale, his infinite variety.</p>

    <p>Scotch Members on before Ireland was approached. Something
    about the Scotch Private Bill Procedure Bill. Formidable List
    of Amendments to LORD-ADVOCATE's proposal to nominate
    Committee. All the Clans muster. NOVAR moves Amendment;
    CAMPBELL-BANNER-MAN objected that thirteen Scotch Members,
    including LENG and LYON PLAYFAIR, "would not make an adequate
    Committee." ROBERT-SON brought against the LORD-ADVOCATE the
    grave charge that he was "interpolating an extraneous and alien
    body into this business." Lord KINGSBURY, ex-Lord-Advocate,
    happened to be under Gallery on chance visit to House. Heard
    this remark with huge delight. Reminded him of the times when
    he used to sit through long nights with back fairly set against
    the Gangway post of Treasury Bench, invoking blessings on head
    of Duke of ARGYLL, and driving the Liberal Scotch Members wild
    with his perpetual smile of content.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Committee on Irish Land Bill
    started.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>.&mdash;When House met at Morning Sitting
    OLD MORALITY discovered on Treasury Bench, looking more than
    usually guileless. Been badgered all week about Labour
    Committee. When going to disclose names of Commissioners and
    set forth terms of reference? Only yesterday Brer RABBIT put
    the question, intimating that whenever the announcement was
    made Adjournment of House would be moved in order to protest
    against omission of DAVITT's name. OLD MORALITY answering, said
    it was possible he might be able to make the announcement
    to-day, but much more likely on Monday.</p>

    <p>Everyone thought it would be Monday. Brer RABBIT in his
    place to-day, but his men absent. OLD MORALITY, with positively
    a halo of innocency round his head, suddenly appeared at table;
    read out the list of Commissioners. Brer RABBIT's hand forced;
    must needs forthwith ask leave to move the Adjournment.</p>

    <p>"Got your forty men?" asked the SPEAKER.</p>

    <p>"Not quite," said Brer RABBIT, apologetically.</p>

    <p>Only twenty-nine; so Brer RABBIT bowled out, and opportunity
    lost.</p>

    <p>"Dear me!" said OLD MORALITY; "how very unfortunate. Now if
    I'd only waited till Monday, House would have been quite full;
    Brer RABBIT would have got his forty men twice over; we should
    have had an embarrassing Debate, and lost several hours of the
    sitting. As things have turned out, we can now go straight on
    with business."</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
